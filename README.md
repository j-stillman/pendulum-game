Creating eye-catching images with swinging pendulums

My inspiration for this project was "actually using the math you learn in school". I really enjoyed trigonometry so I made it a point to use the sine and cosine trig functions. After some experimentation with ideas in other programs, I decided to create an interface where the user can create swinging pendulums of varying speeds whose paths get traced. The resulting images can be quite interesting to look at. I would find it interesting to see what other users create.

The frame-by-frame loop in which the pendulums spin was inspired by those of GameMaker and Unity, characterized by a "create" event and an "update" event for each entity. I see potential to repurpose this for a game made from scratch in Java, if one desired to do so.
